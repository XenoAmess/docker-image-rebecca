**There be rumours that we named this project for "Rebecca can be compressed into a very flat pie easily, taken small amount of effort and time cost, while the output be extremely small size", but those rumours be never officially confirmed.**

## But How?

Find duplicated files.

Replace them to a link file(content be a sha512, and all other tar properties remains), then add the file list into the outer tar.

## And How To Use It?

Just invoke the uber jar I provided, and see the help doc printed.
